This starter kit is designed to get you up and running with a bunch of awesome front-end technologies.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a stable foundation upon which to build modern web appliications. Its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete real-world application, but to provide a set of tools intended to make front-end development robust and easy.

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

Then open [http://localhost:8091/](http://localhost:8091/) to see your app.

## Creating an app

**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
$ npx create-react-webpack-project my-app
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

### npm

```sh
$ npm init react-webpack-project my-app
```

_`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+_

### yarn

```sh
$ yarn create react-webpack-project my-app
```

_`yarn create` is available in Yarn 0.25+_

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies. See [Project Structure](#project-structure).

## Generated App

### Running the App

After completing the previous steps, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

| `yarn <script>`       | Description                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`               | Serves your app at `localhost:8091`                                                                                     |
| `build:dev`           | Builds the application to ./build (_the build output dir could be configured in `./config/common-paths.js`_)            |
| `build:dev:watch`     | Builds the application and watch for changes                                                                            |
| `build:dev:analyze`   | Builds the application with Bundle Analyzer and Visualizer Plugins instaled                                             |
| `build:dev:dashboard` | Builds the application with Dashboard                                                                                   |
| `serve:dev:dashboard` | Builds the application with Dashboard                                                                                   |
| `test`                | Runs unit tests with Jest. See [testing](#testing)                                                                      |
| `test:watch`          | Runs `test` in watch mode to re-run tests when changed                                                                  |
| `lint`                | [Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors                    |
| `lint:fix`            | Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix) |

## Live Development

### Hot Reloading

Hot reloading is enabled by default when the application is running in development mode (`yarn start`). This feature is implemented with webpack's [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) capabilities, where code updates can be injected to the application while it's running, no full reload required. Here's how it works:

For **JavaScript** modules, a code change will trigger the application to re-render from the top of the tree. **Global state is preserved (i.e. redux), but any local component state is reset**. This differs from React Hot Loader, but we've found that performing a full re-render helps avoid subtle bugs caused by RHL patching.

## Testing

To add a unit test, create a `.test.js` file anywhere inside of `./test`. Jest and webpack will automatically find these files.

## Deployment

Out of the box, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `./build` folder generated by `yarn build:prod`. This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure, since that demands a more opinionated structure that makes it difficult to extend the starter kit. The simplest deployment strategy is a static deployment.

_the build output dir could be configured in `./config/common-paths.js`_
